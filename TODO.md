## TO DO

# SMALL

Be smarter about home / away splits -- take into account neutral site games (probably just use all away features instead?)
	* Need to add a neutral site flag on scrape ✅
	* Filter those out from the aggregates

Add debug mode that will run with much fewer games to make sure the code completes

Add TQDM, fewer print calls

# MEDIUM

Add Guess the Lines with Cousin Sal
	* Find
	* Download
	* Transcribe
	* Segment
	* Summarize by game
Add prediction markets
Injury Adjustment Agent needs some serious work
	* I don't trust the impact scores, need to dig into how they're created
	* Let the code generated by Claude handle the scraping, I'll handle the report
	* How do I deal with the fact that a player may have been injured all season or for the full window of features?

# LARGE

# VERY LARGE

Add travel data points
