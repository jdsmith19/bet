## TO DO

# SMALL

Be smarter about home / away splits -- take into account neutral site games (probably just use all away features instead?)

# MEDIUM

Change how I pull upcoming games
	* Pull all upcoming games from ProFootballReference
	* Include Week #
	# Use query of current data set of complete games to find upcoming games

# LARGE
